Cronômetro de Exercícios

📌 Overview
The Cronômetro de Exercícios is an app developed as part of Estácio de Sá University's extension project for the Android Mobile Programming discipline. Created in Kotlin using Android Studio, the app was designed to optimize cardio workouts (such as jumping jacks, squats, and others), eliminating the need to stop and check the time on your phone.

🎯 Purpose
Many people who practice physical activities waste time and concentration by constantly checking their phones to control the duration of their sets. The Exercise Timer solves this problem by allowing the user to set personalized intervals for exercises, rest, and preparation, using vibration signals to indicate each transition, without the need to view the device screen.

⚙️ Operation
The application operates in a continuous cycle divided into three phases:

Preparation (adjustable time for positioning) → Vibrates 2 times

Exercise (configurable duration) → Vibrates 4 times (highlighting the start of the effort)

Pause/Rest (custom interval) → Vibrates 2 times

This cycle repeats according to the number of series defined by the user.

🔄 Loop Flow:
Preparation → Exercise → Preparation → Pause (per series)

✨ Main Features
✔ Custom configuration:

Exercise time

Number of series

Pause duration

Preparation time (to enter/exit the position)

✔ Vibration feedback:

2 vibrations: indicates the start of preparation or pause.

4 vibrations: signals the start of the exercise (clear differentiation).

✔ Practical mode:

It works in the background (ideal for staying focused on training).

It does not require constant interaction with the screen.

📲 Use Case
Imagine an athlete doing jumping jacks:

The phone vibrates twice → he positions himself during the preparation time.

The phone vibrates 4 times → he starts the exercise for the configured period.

The phone vibrates twice again → it indicates the moment to rest.

This way, the user maximizes his performance without interruptions.
